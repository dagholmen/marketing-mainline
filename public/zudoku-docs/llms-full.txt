## Document: Authentication

URL: /authentication


# Authentication
All B2BEnrich API endpoints are authenticated using an API key.

## API key authentication

The API uses a simple but secure authentication scheme:

- **Type:** API key
- **Location:** HTTP header
- **Header name:** `X-Api-Key`

This authentication scheme is required for every API request.

## Base URL

The API is hosted at:

- Production: `https://api.b2benrich.com`

## Send the API key

Include your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header on every request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.b2benrich.com/v1/enrich/cached/person/linkedin-to-person \
  -H "X-Api-Key: your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/example"
  }'
```

For convenience, you can export your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export B2BENRICH_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Then reference it in your requests:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.b2benrich.com/v1/enrich/cached/person/linkedin-to-person \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $B2BENRICH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/example"
  }'
```

## Example authenticated requests

All API operations are JSON `POST` requests with a simple `input` field.

### Person enrichment example

Enrich a person profile from their LinkedIn URL:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.b2benrich.com/v1/enrich/cached/person/linkedin-to-person \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $B2BENRICH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe"
  }'
```

### Organization enrichment example

Enrich a company from its domain:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.b2benrich.com/v1/enrich/cached/org/domain-to-org \
  -H "X-Api-Key: $B2BENRICH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "example.com"
  }'
```

## Error responses

The API returns standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests:

| Status Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `200` | Successful request |
| `400` | Bad request - check your input format |
| `401` | Unauthorized - missing or invalid API key |

| `403` | Forbidden - access denied |
| `404` | Not found - resource doesn't exist |

| `422` | Validation error - invalid input data |
| `429` | Too many requests - rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal server error |
| `502` | Upstream service error |

### Error response format

All errors follow a consistent JSON structure:

```json
{
  "detail": "Error message describing what went wrong",
  "code": "error",
  "extra": {}
}
```

### Authentication error example

```json
{
  "detail": "Unauthorized (missing/invalid X-Api-Key)",
